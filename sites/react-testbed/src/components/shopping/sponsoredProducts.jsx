The quantum transport solution works flawlessly, creating stable portals every time. Just be careful with your calculations if you\'re using bootleg fluid!' },

The device is easy to use, though I wish it came with a manual. Also, be prepared for some wild adventures and potential dangers in other universes.' },
  //     { id: 3, username: 'InterdimensionalRick', rating: 5, title: 'Essential for Any Rick', comment: 'As the smartest being in the multiverse, I can confidently say this portal gun is a masterpiece. The sleek design fits perfectly in my lab coat, and the display face shows all the info I need. Just don\'t let the Citadel track you!' },
  //     { id: 4, username: 'FederationAgent', rating: 3, title: 'Impressive but Restricted', comment: 'The technology is undeniably advanced, allowing for interdimensional travel. However, without the specific calculations for green portal fluid, our blue portals are limited to inner-dimensional travel. Still trying to crack Rick\'s formula.' },
  //     { id: 5, username: 'BethSmith', rating: 4, title: 'Family Adventures Made Easy', comment: 'Dad\'s portal gun has certainly made family outings more interesting. It\'s convenient for quick escapes and visiting exotic locations. Just wish he\'d stop using it to avoid difficult conversations at the dinner table.' }

  //   description: "The portal gun is a handheld device invented by Rick Sanchez that enables interdimensional and intradimensional travel in the Rick and Morty universe. It resembles a futuristic firearm with a predominantly white, silver, and gray color scheme, featuring a small display screen and a circular barrel that emits a bright green light when fired. The device generates green, circular portals approximately 6 feet in diameter, allowing users to travel instantly between different locations within the same universe or to parallel universes and dimensions. It's powered by a special \"Quantum Portal Solution\" or \"portal fluid\" and requires complex calculations to target specific universes accurately. The portal gun has additional features such as a travel history log, remote tracking capabilities, and the ability to create self-imploding portals in emergencies. While the exact science behind it isn't fully explained, it's believed to involve advanced quantum mechanics and possibly creates stable wormholes between points in space-time. This iconic invention represents both incredible scientific achievement and potential danger, making it one of the most sought-after technologies in the Rick and Morty multiverse."

          "This feels more like a spin-off than a true sequel, spending most of its runtime rehashing the original through court scenes and interviews, rather than pushing the story forward. The writing is serviceable at best, often relying on thin threads to loosely tie one musical dream sequence to the next. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fine, but it lacks the raw intensity that defined his portrayal in the original. Lady Gaga, on the other hand, seemed to intentionally tone down her usual flamboyance, likely to avoid overshadowing him, which, while understandable, feels like a missed opportunity for a more dynamic performance.",

          "I can see why people don't like this film. However those wanting a repeat of the first film will be very disappointed. This film is a complete reverse of the first film where we saw Arthur Fleck grow into Joker. This film dismantles all of that, and our expectations. The cinematography and lighting is incredible as is the acting, aside from Steve Coogan who jars but even Alan Partridge pronunciations are picked up by Arthur! Gaga Iis brilliant and so is Gleason as a hatedul prison guard.",

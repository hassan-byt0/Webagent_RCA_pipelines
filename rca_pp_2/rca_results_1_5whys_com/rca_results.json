          "Why did the automated agent fail to interact correctly with the Angular dropdown components?",
          "The agent failed because it did not recognize the dynamically rendered dropdown elements triggered by Angular's change detection cycle. The Angular components use event binding (e.g., (click)='toggleDropdown()') to manage dropdown visibility, which isn't detected by the agent's static DOM analysis.",
          "Why didn't the agent recognize dynamically rendered elements?",
          "The agent's DOM parsing logic runs at initial page load and does not account for elements added or modified by Angular's runtime data binding and DOM manipulation methods. Angular modifies the DOM based on user interactions and data state changes, which are not visible to the agent's initial static scan.",
          "Why does the agent use a static DOM parsing logic?",
          "The agent was originally designed to interact with static web pages where the DOM does not change after the initial page load. This design does not include mechanisms like MutationObserver to detect changes in the DOM after the initial load, which is essential for handling SPA frameworks like Angular.",
          "Why was MutationObserver or similar dynamic DOM listening not implemented?",
          "The initial architecture of the agent did not anticipate the need to support single-page applications (SPAs) that require real-time DOM monitoring. The design assumed that web pages would not have substantial DOM changes without full page reloads, which is not the case with modern SPAs.",
          "Why was the agent not updated to support modern SPA frameworks?",
          "Updating the agent to support SPAs involves significant changes in its core architecture to incorporate asynchronous event handling and dynamic DOM updates. Such an update requires extensive testing and redevelopment, which may not have been prioritized or feasible within the project's scope or timeline."

          "Why did the agent fail to identify and interact with Vue.js dropdown elements?",
          "The agent failed because the dropdown elements are dynamically generated by Vue.js and are not present in the initial DOM snapshot taken by the agent's static analysis system.",
          "Why are the dropdown elements not present in the initial DOM snapshot?",
          "Vue.js applications manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to dynamically render content based on user interactions or state changes. The dropdown elements are rendered after the initial page load, based on user actions that trigger Vue.js methods.",
          "Why doesn't the agent's system detect changes made by Vue.js to the DOM?",
          "The agent's system likely uses a static DOM parsing approach without a mechanism like MutationObserver to detect changes in the DOM after the initial page load. This results in the agent missing elements added by Vue.js dynamically.",
          "Why was a static DOM parsing approach used instead of a dynamic monitoring approach?",
          "The static approach is simpler and less resource-intensive, suitable for pages with little or no JavaScript-driven changes. However, it fails in modern web applications like SPAs (Single Page Applications) where the DOM is highly dynamic.",
          "Why wasn't SPA compatibility considered in the original architecture of the agent?",
          "When the agent was originally designed, traditional multi-page applications (MPAs) were more common, and the need for handling dynamic content changes typical of SPAs wasn't as critical. The architecture didn't evolve to include modern web practices."

Focus remains on UI interaction complexities.,"Enhance the automation tool's capability to interact with Angular-based elements or any other frameworks detected. | Implement a more robust element detection and interaction strategy, possibly integrating with browser dev tools to better understand element structures and hierarchies. | Consider using explicit waits or checks for element visibility and availability to handle AJAX-loaded content more effectively. | Review and adjust the indexing method for interactive elements to ensure all actionable items can be accessed by the automation scripts. | Test and refine the interaction scripts in a controlled environment to handle dropdowns and hidden elements more reliably.","The primary issue stems from the automation tool's inability to effectively interact with and navigate through the site's dropdown menus, potentially due to advanced UI frameworks like Angular. This is compounded by possible asynchronous content loading and inadequate handling of dynamically generated elements. The repeated failures to locate and interact with specific product categories indicate a need for enhanced tool capabilities and interaction strategies."

            "question": "Why was the task unsuccessful with the Bootstrap framework?",
            "answer": "The automated agent failed to recognize and interact with the Bootstrap-specific classes and IDs due to its configuration, which was not tailored to identify and manipulate elements rendered by Bootstrap's JavaScript components."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why couldn't the agent recognize Bootstrap-specific classes and IDs?",
            "answer": "The agent's element recognition system is configured primarily for basic HTML and CSS properties and does not include a library or module to parse and interact with frameworks like Bootstrap that dynamically manipulate the DOM using JavaScript."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why doesn't the agent's system include a module for frameworks like Bootstrap?",
            "answer": "The initial design of the agent's architecture did not anticipate the need to handle multiple front-end frameworks and focused only on static HTML content, lacking the implementation of a flexible module to adapt to different DOM manipulations."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why was the agent designed to handle only static HTML content?",
            "answer": "The agent was originally developed during a period when static websites were more common, and the rapid evolution to dynamic web applications using various frameworks was not fully anticipated by the developers."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why wasn't the evolution to dynamic web applications anticipated?",
            "answer": "There was a lack of foresight in the industry trend towards highly interactive and dynamically rendered web applications, and the development team did not update the agent's capabilities in line with these technological advancements."

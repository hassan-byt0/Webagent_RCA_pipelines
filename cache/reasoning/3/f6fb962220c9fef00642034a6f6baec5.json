"- **Error Handling and Navigation**: The system is designed to handle errors and navigate through pages efficiently. If a page is not fully loaded, a wait action is used. Alternative approaches are considered if the desired elements are not found, such as going back to a previous page or opening a new tab.\n\n- **Action Sequences**: Actions are executed in sequence as specified, with a focus on efficiency. For instance, form filling actions are grouped together unless a significant page change occurs. The sequence stops if the page state changes significantly after an action.\n\n- **Interactive Elements**: Only elements with numeric indexes in brackets are interactive. The system uses these indexes to interact with elements, following the provided rules and sequences.\n\n- **Task Completion and Memory Tracking**: The system uses the 'done' action as the last step once the ultimate task is complete, ensuring all requested information is included. It keeps track of actions performed and remaining through the 'memory' field, ensuring all parts of the task are completed as requested.\n\n- **Visual Context and Extraction**: Visual aids like images are used to understand the page layout and interact with elements correctly. Information extraction is performed as needed, using the 'extract_content' action on specific pages."
